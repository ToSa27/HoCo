# HoCo
Home Control Framework

Modular home control framework based on esp8266 modules and node.js server as central controller:

For esp8266 firmware see https://github.com/ToSa27/HoCo-esp8266

For node.js server see https://github.com/ToSa27/HoCo-server

Key capabilities:
- robust bootloader
- robust over the air firmware updates
- highly configurable
- minimizing single points of failure


No focus on battery driven nodes. Potentially investigate low power node extension (e.g. NRF24) at a later point.
